    "As mentioned earlier, **Tensors are n-dimensional arrays that can be passed between operations in a graph.** It's the same idea as an `ndarray` in NumPy. Previously, our Tensors were rank 0, or scalars. In the following example, we'll use Tensors of rank 1 (vectors) and Tensors of rank 2 (matrices). As you can guess, rank is the number of dimensions in a Tensor. The shape of a Tensor is a list containing its size in each dimension.\n",

    "You might be wondering why TensorFlow uses a graph and computes everything at the end, instead of when nodes are declared. One reason is so that there can be placeholders - Tensors that can be operated on just like constant Tensors, but their value is unknown until specified when evaluating. However, you must specify the datatype of a placeholder when declaring it, and while not necessary, it's often good practice to specify the shape too. Here, we let `x` be a placeholder.\n",
